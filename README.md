# Diabetes Regression using PyTorch

This notebook uses the `load_diabetes` dataset from `sklearn` to perform linear regression using PyTorch.

- Preprocessed the dataset using StandardScaler.
- Built a linear regression model using `nn.Linear`.
- Trained for 500 epochs using MSE loss and SGD optimizer.
- Plotted training loss curve and evaluated on the test set.
- Visualized predicted vs true values.

## How to run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or VS Code to run and visualize the outputs.
